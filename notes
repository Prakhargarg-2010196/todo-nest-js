modules are some structuring components that help nest to draw application graph as to which component is depending on what and how to structure the application well
 

modules carry 4 things 

1. Providers : These are major nest component classes that can be used internally as providers []  and as well as externally using exports[].

2. imports: These are the modules that are required by the current module for usage and should be imported 

3. exports : Providers from current module that need to be exported for use by other services.

4. controllers : These are the components that help us define the request and response basically http data in general.

The modules can use only those providers that are either provided by them or exported from the modules in imports []. 

modules are singletons (meaning : same instance can be shared b/w several modules)
